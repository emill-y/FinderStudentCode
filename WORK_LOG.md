| October 30th  | 40 minutes of Classtime |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I worked on conceptualizing with my classmates on how to solve the problem at hand. Hannah came to the realization of using a combination of a TST and a hash-- and that got me thinking, that what if thats how a hash map function works? So I opened up the code for the hash-map function using the tools that this IDE gives me, and looked into what major underlying data structure was being used to implement a hash map. I realized that there was some sort of tree/node based structure, and decided to try to implement that, creating a hash map to solve the problem. |
| November 3rd  |     5:30 - 6:00 am      | I finally properly opened my code and began coding, and realized that the hash map function was really just a graph theory approach-- but since they had implemented all optimizations, it got very complex. I decided to do something more similar to what hannah was mentioning earlier (because that basically was how a hash map functions...) and initialized a simple hash function, and a very simple node class that stores key value pairs. With just these, and the idea of treating the input and outputs as key value pairs-- like people do in a real hash map, I had an outline for all of the elements I had to code. I just needed to decide how exactly I was going to connect and structure my graph. I wanted  to keep it simple for the first iteration-- however, thinking of the runtime of this algrotihm, I will likley have to re-implement either another graphical data structure, or optimize this current structure, otherwise the runtime will still be proportional to some factor of the csv's length. I finished coding my base level data structure. |

I began by initializing the table, and finishing the query function. I also ran into an error with the length of my key value pairs-- so I trimmed them in my original function, which I believe is causing an error in my testProducts() usecase. This is because it returns the correct answer without a space in the front, which seems like quite an easy fix-- but-- when i get rid of the trim, I run into errors, so I will have to figure out some way to get around that. Other than that, it passes all test cases-- albeit slowly-- meaning that the algorithm functions. |

It was my attempt at an optimization, trimming all of the key value pairs before they entered the table, which quickly backfired on me. Simply by removing the trim function, I was able to get my code to pass all of the functions, because it didnt remove the needed extra space. |

After realizing this, I realized I could still reuse most of my hash function, and just remove the overarching structure, replacing the nodes with the table format. I began by cleaning up my old code. |

I began with initializing and creating the table data structure, and defining needed constants. I initially ran into some errors because I kept getting index out of bound errors, but then I realized it was looping around more than once, so I added a line ensuring the search stops and doesn't overflow the table. I also implemented the resize function, though I'm not sure if it was the most efficient way to do so. If time permits, I'll likley come back to it, and see if there are any optimizations I can make for it to take up less space. |

After closign all of my many many tabs to correctly test it, I realized that there was definately something wrong, becasue even my elements test case was taking almost a second. I realized that the error was that I was looping over ever element still in my loop, by accident, because I was adding elements before hashing them correctly. I re-ordered my code ( and made sure to use the functions I defined) which ended up fixing my problem. |

I realized that if I generated a new prime number for hashing, then the resulting hash would be optimized. Hence, I created a funtion that generated a new prime number within a certain range of n, providing space benefits (and I hope.. a minor speed up..) With testing with and without the function I did see time improvements, albeit minor, meaning they could just be due to sampling variabliilty. I don't know if the extra time of calculating the prime cancels out any beneifts. |
