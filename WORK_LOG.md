| October 30th  | 40 minutes of Classtime |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I worked on conceptualizing with my classmates on how to solve the problem at hand. Hannah came to the realization of using a combination of a TST and a hash-- and that got me thinking, that what if thats how a hash map function works? So I opened up the code for the hash-map function using the tools that this IDE gives me, and looked into what major underlying data structure was being used to implement a hash map. I realized that there was some sort of tree/node based structure, and decided to try to implement that, creating a hash map to solve the problem. |
| November 3rd  |     5:30 - 6:00 am      | I finally properly opened my code and began coding, and realized that the hash map function was really just a graph theory approach-- but since they had implemented all optimizations, it got very complex. I decided to do something more similar to what hannah was mentioning earlier (because that basically was how a hash map functions...) and initialized a simple hash function, and a very simple node class that stores key value pairs. With just these, and the idea of treating the input and outputs as key value pairs-- like people do in a real hash map, I had an outline for all of the elements I had to code. I just needed to decide how exactly I was going to connect and structure my graph. I wanted  to keep it simple for the first iteration-- however, thinking of the runtime of this algrotihm, I will likley have to re-implement either another graphical data structure, or optimize this current structure, otherwise the runtime will still be proportional to some factor of the csv's length. I finished coding my base level data structure. |

I began by initializing the table, and finishing the query function. I also ran into an error with the length of my key value pairs-- so I trimmed them in my original function, which I believe is causing an error in my testProducts() usecase. This is because it returns the correct answer without a space in the front, which seems like quite an easy fix-- but-- when i get rid of the trim, I run into errors, so I will have to figure out some way to get around that. Other than that, it passes all test cases-- albeit slowly-- meaning that the algorithm functions.  |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
